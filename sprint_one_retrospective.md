# Sprint One Retrospective
## What Went Well
>- We really came together and worked well togeether
>- Strong understanding of what everyones strengths and weaknesses were to make sure that we utilized our resources properly
>- Very selfless attitude that didn't lead to a lot of conflict
>- Good communication on what we wanted to accomplish each day

## What Didn't
>- Should have planned the whole project better from the beginning. Had some pseudo-code, but we would still add stuff on the fly
>- Could have asked for help more often that I did.
>- Needed some work on group time management
>- Got bogged down in the weeds sometimes instead of tryig to see things from the big picture
>- Tried to take on too big of a work load at times and it slowed us down
